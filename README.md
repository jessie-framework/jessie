## FAQ

**Why?**

I was making an app for Linux/Android and had issues with multiple frameworks.

**What's your goal?**

I wanna be able to make all my apps with this framework.

**Why will you succeed?**

I am not promising anything. Apart from being frusturated with my own problems I just enjoy the process of making a new API from scratch.
